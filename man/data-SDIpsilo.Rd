\usage{
data(SDIpsilo)

\itemize{
\item \code{id}: study participant.
\item \code{time}: time (in minutes) since psilocibin intake.
\item \code{datapoint}: \code{"signal"} or \code{"noise"}. Indicates when the SDI measurement was done just after the participant visited the toilet which substantively, but temporarily, disrupted the experience (noise)
\item \code{score}: SDI score between 0 and 10
